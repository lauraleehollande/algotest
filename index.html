      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Once upon a time, in the bustling city of Eldoria,
        there existed a mystical gate hidden deep within the dense forests on the outskirts.
        Legends whispered of this gate leading to another world, a realm of magic and wonder.
        Few believed in such tales, dismissing them as mere fantasy.

        continue your journey through the forest.
        However, as you venture deeper into the woods, you come across a wounded creature lying on the ground.
        It's a mystical being from Eldoria, injured while fleeing from the Dark Lord's minions.

        Filled with compassion, you tend to the creature's wounds and earn its gratitude.
        In return, it offers to guide you through the forest,
        revealing hidden paths and secrets unknown to ordinary travelers.
