        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Once upon a time, in the bustling city of Eldoria, 
          there existed a mystical gate hidden deep within the dense forests on the outskirts.
          Legends whispered of this gate leading to another world, a realm of magic and wonder.
          Few believed in such tales, dismissing them as mere fantasy.

          you stumble upon this gate while wandering through the woods.
          What do you want to do ?

          Curiosity overtakes you, and you decide to step through the gate. 
          As you do, a blinding light surrounds you, and when it fades, 
          you find yourself in a breathtaking world filled with vibrant colors and strange creatures. 
          This is Eldoria, the land beyond the gate.
        
          As you pass through the gate, you have a choice to make.
          The Eldorians see you as a hero and offer you different weapons to choose from.

        <p>Uncertain of the gate's authenticity, you decide to leave it behind and 
          continue your journey through the forest. 
          However, as you venture deeper into the woods, you come across a wounded creature lying on the ground. 
          It's a mystical being from Eldoria, injured while fleeing from the Dark Lord's minions.

          Filled with compassion, you tend to the creature's wounds and earn its gratitude. 
          In return, it offers to guide you through the forest, 
          revealing hidden paths and secrets unknown to ordinary travelers.

          you have to create your own weapons
