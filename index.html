        <p>
          Once upon a time, in the bustling city of Eldoria, 
          there existed a mystical gate hidden deep within the dense forests on the outskirts.
          Legends whispered of this gate leading to another world, a realm of magic and wonder.
          Few believed in such tales, dismissing them as mere fantasy.

          you stumble upon this gate while wandering through the woods.
          What do you want to do ?

          As you pass through the gate, you have a choice to make.
          The Eldorians see you as a hero and offer you different weapons to choose from.
