        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Once upon a time, in the bustling city of Eldoria, 
          there existed a mystical gate hidden deep within the dense forests on the outskirts.
          Legends whispered of this gate leading to another world, a realm of magic and wonder.
          Few believed in such tales, dismissing them as mere fantasy.

          you stumble upon this gate while wandering through the woods.
          What do you want to do ?

          As you pass through the gate, you have a choice to make.
          The Eldorians see you as a hero and offer you different weapons to choose from.

        <h2>Chapter 2b: Ignore the gate</h2>
        <p>Uncertain of the gate's authenticity, you decide to leave it behind and 
          continue your journey through the forest. 
          However, as you venture deeper into the woods, you come across a wounded creature lying on the ground. 
          It's a mystical being from Eldoria, injured while fleeing from the Dark Lord's minions.

          Filled with compassion, you tend to the creature's wounds and earn its gratitude. 
          In return, it offers to guide you through the forest, 
          revealing hidden paths and secrets unknown to ordinary travelers.
          
          As you journey alongside the mystical creature, 
          you learn about Eldoria's plight and the looming threat of the Dark Lord. 
          Although you initially chose to ignore the gate, 
          fate seems to have other plans for you as you find yourself inexorably drawn 
          into the conflict brewing in this magical realm.
          
          Regardless of the path you choose, your decisions will shape the destiny of Eldoria. 
          Will you rise as the hero the world desperately needs, 
          or will you forge your own path in this enchanting land? 
          The choice is yours to make, and the consequences will be profound.</p>
